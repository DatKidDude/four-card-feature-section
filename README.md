## About The Project

In this challenge I will be building a responsive 4 card, 3 column layout using Bootstrap. This is my second project using Bootstrap and my main focus was to get more comfortable working with it.

Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Google Fonts
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap5
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma

## What I Learned

This was my second project using Bootstrap 5. I am getting a lot more comfortable using the Bootstrap properties and I now have a better understanding of how their grid system works. I am familiar with vanilla CSS but using Bootstrap has made me think of more efficient ways that I can write my CSS.

## Useful Resources

Figma - Paste the design image inside of figma to check containers, width, etc...

## Acknowledgments
